## Project description

##### Flowerfield is an application where the user is able to collect <em>flowers</em> by taking pictures of them.

When a picture is taken, it can then be uploaded to the app, where the picture is processed and identified by an external image-identification API - [plant.id ](https://web.plant.id/plant-identification-api/).
If the picture is successfully identified, it will add the flower to the user's collection.
The collection of flowers is divided into subcategories based on the families/species, which makes the user able to collect sets of types of vegetation.
Xp is gained for collecting flowers as well as completing entire sets, leveling up in the process and getting a cosmetic rank.<br>

The app targets towards users intressted in botany, outside exploration or general gardenkeeping - encouraging slowing down, and appreciating one's own surroundings.
